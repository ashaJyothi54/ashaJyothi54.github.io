---
🍃My name is Asha Jyothi 😃. I am from Hyderabad and 20 years old. I am very much attracted to stories and Leelas of srimannarayana 😍 which are explained by Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao gaaru . I am trying to see the world without maaya , but I am attracted to maaaya too 😞. May be, by listening and writing Leelas of Govinda , I can remove my sins. So, i am trying to, but  it is all in Krishna's hand 🙏.     
### My Story💜💛
At very first I am non devotee of Lord Vishnu 😟. I sometimes think about how the body survive, after death what happens 🤔 etc . But never try to find answer. From the begining, I know the power of luck, and but dont know how the luck works on differnet persons. Here, Luck can be intelligence, richness. I got always doubt, why one person is rich, other person is poor, what is the difference and why some people are very wise and others are not. Like this, I have many doubts in my mind 😆 upto before started my devotion stage. 

🍃At first,  I am very poor in hindi 😌, I thought hindi is last in 10th class. But it came again in btech, so i really want to learn hindi( acutally no interest 😌). Many people recommended to watch serials, so I started to watch Mahabharat Serial in hindi, but I didnt understand one sentence also 😅. I continued to watch in telugu, there i was attracted to story 💞and watched 2 times. Later tried to "Bhagavat Geetha as it is". Read only 2 lessons, in that book, it is  mentioned Lord Shiva as small god 😞, but it is not true. So, lost intrest in reading that book. I have habit of reading answers in Quora. there i found a very spritual answer, written by one 18yrs girl 🔥. I chatted with her, to know what to read, where to learn 📚. She is very great devotee of Lord Venketeshwara 😍, she shared all sources to listen. She recommoned to listen the Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao Talks 💚. But i listened only one to two series fully(Gajendra Moksha 🐘🐊, Kapila Geetha 💎). i am loosing interest on studies day by day 😫 . Some times, i was attracted to surroundings well😢. Hoping, may Narayana make me strong to not to attract. . First Serial, next the book, and then talks . So in this way, i was attracted to Srinivasa 😁. My always desire is to see his 10000000 suns🌞🌞🌞 glowing face and to touch his lotus feet 🌷.

My name is Asha Jyothi :smiley:.  I am from Hyderabad and 20 years old. I am very much 
attracted to stories and Leelas of srimannarayana :heart_eyes: which are explained by Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao gaaru . I am trying to see the world without maaya , but I am attracted to maaaya too :disappointed: . May be, by listening and writing Leelas of Govinda , I can remove my sins. So, i am trying to, but  it is all in Krishna's hand :pray:.     
### My Story:purple_heart::yellow_heart:
At very first I am non devotee of Lord Vishnu :worried:. I sometimes think about how the 
body survive, after death what happens ðŸ¤” etc. But never try to find answer. At first,  
I am very poor in hindi :relieved:, I thought hindi is last in 10th class. 
But it came again in btech, so i really want to learn hindi( acutally no interest :sweat:).
Many people recommended to watch serials, so I started to watch Mahabharat Serial
in hindi, but I didnt understand one sentence also :sweat_smile:. I continued to watch in telugu,
there i was attracted to story :revolving_hearts:and watched 2 times. Later tried to "Bhagavat Geetha as it is". Read only 2 lessons, in that book, it is  mentioned Lord Shiva as small god :disappointed:, but it is not true. So, lost intrest in reading that book. I have habit of reading answers in Quora. there i found a very spritual answer, written by one 18yrs girl :fire:. I chatted with her, to know what to read, where to learn :books:. She is very great devotee of Lord Venketeshwara :heart_eyes:, she shared all sources to listen. She recommoned to listen the Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao Talks :green_heart:. But i listend only  one to two series fully(Gajendra Moksha :elephant::crocodile:, Kapila Geetha :gem:). i am loosing interest  on studies day by day :tired_face: . Some times, i was attracted to surroundings well:cry:. Hoping, may narayana make me strong to not to attract. . First Serial, next the book, and then talks . So in this way, i  was attracted to Srinivasa :grin:. My always desire is to see his 10000000 suns:sun_with_face::sun_with_face::sun_with_face: glowing face and to touch his lotus feet :tulip:.
